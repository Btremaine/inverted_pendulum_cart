*Install files in a Matlab directory (Inverted_Pendulum_Cart)
* Run script pendulum_cart.m to define the system and calculate
* matricies CO and OB and the LQR gain vector.
* Uses full-state feedback.

* Simulink file Inv_pendulum_cart_non_linear.slx is the full
* simulation using the non-linear plant model. 
* Inv_pendulum_cart_plant is only the non-linear plant model for reference.
